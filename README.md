OIBSIP Data Science Internship

Hello, everyone!

I hope you're all doing well. I'm thrilled to share my journey as a Data Science intern at Oasis Infobyte. It has been an exciting and enriching experience.

At the beginning of my internship, I was eager to explore the vast world of Data Science. Oasis Infobyte provided a comprehensive overview of the internship program, outlining the tasks I would be working on and the skills I would need. I had a whole month to complete the internship, and I was expected to complete at least three out of five tasks. With a strong foundation in Python and machine learning algorithms, I was ready to take on the challenges.

One of the most fulfilling aspects of my internship was the opportunity to work on real projects. I was entrusted with a range of tasks, from data cleaning and preprocessing to building predictive models. The sense of responsibility and ownership I felt throughout these projects was truly rewarding.

Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification
For this task, I worked with the Iris Flower dataset and applied the Logistic Regression algorithm to build a model. The goal was to categorize flowers into their respective species. I achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.37%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model. I also used the model to predict the species for a fresh set of data and obtained accurate results.



Task 2 - Unemployment Analysis
In this task, I analyzed Unemployment dataset using Python. I utilized libraries like pandas and numpy to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The analysis included various data visualizations and animations, created using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the unemployment situation across different states, supporting informed decision-making.



Task 3 - Car Price Prediction
For this task, I worked with the Car Price dataset and applied Linear Regression and Lasso Regression algorithms to build predictive models. I conducted in-depth analyses of the dataset and created various visualizations to gain a better understanding of the data.
